        <h2>Ragnar Lothbrok</h2>
        <p>
          Originally a farmer, Viking Ragnar Lothbrok claims to be descended from the god Odin.
          He becomes Earl of Kattegat after he challenges and kills the ruthless Earl Haraldson.
          He is also a feared warrior, becomes a raider of undiscovered lands, and, eventually, King of Denmark.
          Despite his reputation for ruthlessness and brutality, he is a curious man eager to learn about other cultures.
          Based on the semi-legendary Ragnar Lodbrok.
